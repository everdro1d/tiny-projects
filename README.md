# tiny-projects
A collection of tiny projects that are too small to have their own repo, and that took me less than an hour to write.

## Usage
Use branches to switch between projects.

# ForTheRepublic
A small joke app with a full screen button that when pressed plays the "For The Republic!" sound.
